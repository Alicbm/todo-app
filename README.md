# Todo App :tw-1f4dd:
> "Take control of your habits. Take control of your life".

Welcome! If you want to be in control of your life, this is an excellent tool to organize your week, through habits you can decide your future. To continue, you can see more about this application below.

## Available Scripts
- ** npm start**
	Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

	The page will reload when you make changes.
	You may also see any lint errors in the console.
- **npm test**
	Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

- **npm run build**
	Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

- **npm run eject**
	If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

	Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.
